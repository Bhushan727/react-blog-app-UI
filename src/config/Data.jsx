It is to be noted that the above-mentioned authentication shall be implemented on every login session by the client to IBT and STWT,” the NSE further said in its June 14 notification.",

A day after filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri tweeted about reports that said Ayan Mukerji’s Brahmastra had ‘beaten’ his film, The Kashmir Files, at the box office, actor Kangana Ranaut shared his tweet and took a dig at filmmaker Karan Johar. Brahmastra has been backed by Karan. On Tuesday, Kangana took to Instagram Stories and wrote, “The audacity to belittle The Kashmir Files, a film made on Hindu genocide (and) also trying to ride on its success. The Kashmir Files was made in ₹10 crore…”",

And the jampacked crowd at IS Bindra PCA Stadium was provided both as Australia overhauled a score of 208 with four balls to spare to beat India by four wickets in the first of three T20I.  Matthew Wade, who played a vital role in his team’s T20 World Cup semi-final win over Pakistan in Dubai last year, showed why he is so valuable for his team in the game’s shortest format.  With 64 needed in 35 balls, Australia were second favourites in the match, but the 62-run stand for the sixth wicket between Wade and debutant Tim David turned the tide in favour of the visitors. Wade remained unbeaten on 45 off 21 balls",

        content : "After the highs of the 2018 Commonwealth Games and Asiad, Manika Batra’s career took a nosedive following the Birmingham CWG debacle but the ace Indian paddler has vowed to make a strong return at the National Games before heading to the World Championships this month. Batra was one of India’s biggest stars in 2018, clinching four medals including the women’s singles and team golds at the CWG. She also went on to bag the mixed doubles bronze at the Asian Games later that year. However at the Birmingham Games last month, she looked out of sorts and returned empty-handed. “Of course, I was sad and upset when I lost my matches in CWG but I always tell myself this is not the end of the world,” Batra, who is here for the National Games, told reporters during a virtual interaction. “2018 was really an amazing year for me. This time, I played best before the CWG. I did really well in the World Tours, beat good players,” the top-ranked Indian said. “I think I played my best in CWG but every player has ups and down in their lives. It’s not finished for me just because I didn’t get a medal at the CWG,” she added. Batra said she has been working hard to rectify her mistakes. “I’ve to keep working hard and bounce back. I’ve worked a lot on my mistakes and my coach has been my sparring partner. We have some big tournaments coming up and next year like the Asian Games.”",

The match was yet another salvo in a growing cluster of contests between the two spanning multiple tournaments and different sets of situations.  Carlsen is in the middle of multiple wars at the moment. On one hand, the World Champion refuses to defend his crown due to a variety of reasons – mere months after a marathon battle against Ian Nepomniachtchi which he won 7.5-3.5 (the score may seem lopsided, but the battle between the two was anything but).  On the other hand, Carlsen retired for the second consecutive time against USA’s 19-year-old Grand Master Hans Niemann this week. The insinuation has been that the American has either found a way to cheat without getting caught or has earned his Norwegian counterpart’s ire for his chequered past as a chess cheat in online tournaments.",

Now, Jackie has reacted to Anil's statement. In a new interview, the actor said that when a man of Anil’s calibre says something like that, he was giving Jackie too much respect. Also read: Anil Kapoor was insecure about Jackie Shroff. During Koffee With Karan season 7 episode 11, Karan had asked Anil Kapoor and the other guest on the show, Varun Dhawan, a question about nepotism. Anil had said, I don't take it seriously… When I started my career, at that time it was of course Sunny (Deol), there was Sanju (Sanjay Dutt). When Karan interrupted to add Jackie Shroff's name, Anil had said, Jackie was an outsider in a way, but still he got the first break from Subhash Ghai. So, he himself became like an A-lister just with that one announcement. I, at that time, was doing bit roles, I was doing south Indian films. I did kind of, (was) not feeling good about it… When Karan further asked Anil, Did you feel insecure about Jackie's success at that time? the actor responded by saying, Well yeah. He became a huge, huge success ",

        content : `“Today, it’s easier to become an actor because people have access to social media and other mediums where they can show their talents be it with reels or on YouTube and reach out to the audience. There’s money, ad deals and fan interactions on digital platforms and it’s your call on how approachable you want to be or even how greedy,” says the Balika Vadhu actor.

        Having been in the business for years, she admits it gets difficult for her “to be out there”. “I end up thinking, let’s do it as everyone else is (very active on social media) and it’s not a big deal. But deep down, it doesn’t feel right, hence, I take a step back. For example, making those lip sync reels isn’t something I should do in my career right now even though at the end of the day that seems to get you followers and once you get followers, good brands come to you,” she explains.`,

        content : `Me and Raju bhaiya had a relationship of over 17 years, from 2005 to 2022, ever since The Great Indian Laughter Challenge started. We have seen a lot together. What I used to admire about his comic skills is how he would infuse life into inanimate projects, like a sofa speaking to the occupants to let it breathe, a fan, etc. Plus his comedy was always clean, and never vulgar. These are the things which will keep him alive among us.We were on very cordial terms, and it was always a warm affair whenever we used to visit each other’s houses. Our kids are friends too. Whenever he would prepare a new skit, he would perform it for me and ask if the punches are landing.

        Raju bhaiya gareebon ki madad karte the muthhi band karke. The moment he would get to know that any comedian is struggling, or is new and hasn’t paid rent for months, he would immediately help, because he himself had struggled at one point. He had the blessings of the poor people with him, hence he rose to the top.
